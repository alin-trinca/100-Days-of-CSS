    Dunc the Lunk, thick as a castle wall. Forgive my manners. I don't see many ladies these days. Lucky for the ladies. It is rare to meet a Lannister who shares my enthusiasm for dead Lannisters. A forked purple lightning bolt, on black field speckled with four-pointed stars. The wolf and the lion. Never Resting. May the Father judge him justly. The battle of the redgrass field. Words are like wind. And now his watch is ended

    What is dead may never die. What is dead may never die. Pay the iron price. Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken. When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. Our Sun Shines Bright. The wolf and the lion. The War of the 5 kings. Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken. House Tarly of Horn Hill Forgive my manners. I don't see many ladies these days. Lucky for the ladies. Winter is coming. Bastards are born of passion, aren't they? We don't despise them in Dorne. I would like a trial by combat. The War of the 5 kings. The North remembers. Our Sun Shines Bright. Pay the iron price. King in the North. The tourney of Ashford Meadows.
